Create a service that collect data from cryptocompare.com using its API and stores it in a database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Mongo)
Example API request: GET https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=BTC&tsyms=USD,EUR

REQUIREMENTS:
1. âœ… Currency pairs must be configurable.
2. âœ… Database parameters must be configurable.
3. âœ… Service must store data in database by a scheduler.
4. âœ… If cryptocompare's api is not accessible service must serve data from its database.
5. âœ… API should accept as many fsyms/tsyms in one request as possible (ex.: GET service/price?fsyms=BTC,LINK,MKR&tsyms=USD,EUR,ETH,LTC should return all pair prices)
6. âœ… Data in response must be fresh (realtime). 2-3 minutes discrepancy is ok.

ADDITIONAL POINTS:
1. âœ…âœ…âœ… Service scalability is a plus.
2. ðŸš« Following standard go project layout is a plus.
3. âœ… Websocket API for the service is a plus.
4. [WIP] Using docker to build and run the service is a plus.
5. âœ… Nicely written README with clear instructions is a plus
